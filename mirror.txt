    *******
    
    * Created a new branch called secrets-test in Authentication repo. Set up external secrets using AWS secret manager
      for Authentication service. Edited gitlab-ci.yaml as well as deployment.yaml as well as values.yaml, to use secrets instead
      of ConfigMaps.
      After testing out the whole setup in the new branch, with further confirmation from the developer, merged the changes to develop.
      Performed the same for Auth service in prod cluster as well.
